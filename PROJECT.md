- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Schema design complete and implemented

### Key Components

1. **State Management**
   - `userStore`: User data and authentication
   - `gameStore`: Game state and mechanics
   - `achievementStore`: Achievement tracking
   - `referralStore`: Referral system
   - `taskStore`: Daily tasks and rewards
   - `notificationStore`: System notifications

2. **Database Schema**
   - Users table
   - Token transactions
   - Token transfers
   - Referral codes
   - User statistics
   - Achievements

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Components are organized by feature
- Shared utilities in `/utils`
- Type definitions in `/types`
- Database operations in `/db`
- Services in `/services`

### Best Practices
1. Use TypeScript for type safety
2. Follow React hooks best practices
3. Implement error boundaries
4. Use proper loading states
5. Handle edge cases
6. Write meaningful error messages

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for utilities
2. Component tests for UI
3. Integration tests for flows
4. E2E tests for critical paths

## Deployment

### Requirements
1. Environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   VITE_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
   ```

2. Database setup:
   ```bash
   npm install -g drizzle-kit
   npm run db:push
   ```

### Build Process
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build project: `npm run build`
3. Preview build: `npm run preview`

## Future Improvements
